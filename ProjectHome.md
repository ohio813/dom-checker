# Browser DOM Checker #

A simple utility to thoroughly validate DOM, XMLHttpRequest, and cookie security restriction handling in modern web browsers. Notable features include exhaustive hierarchy crawling, cross-domain IPC system for blind write verification, page transition checks, and more.

The tool consists of a small set of HTML pages with embedded Javascript code and a reporting interface, and may be run directly over HTTP. Please be sure to modify `dom_config.js` to specify correct host names and locations for the hosted code.
